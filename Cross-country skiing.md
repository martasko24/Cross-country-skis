This region offers a diverse range of trails suitable for both beginners and seasoned skiers, all set against the backdrop of stunning alpine scenery. Among places 

- **Jakuszyce (Szklarska Poręba)**
Jakuszyce, situated in the Izera Mountains near the Czech border, stands as Poland's premier cross-country skiing destination. Its extensive network of over 100 kilometers of groomed trails traverses the scenic Izera mountain plateau at an elevation of around 860 meters, ensuring reliable snow conditions throughout the winter season. The Jakuszyce Sport Center serves as the heart of Nordic skiing activities, hosting numerous competitions including the prestigious Bieg Piastów, Poland's largest cross-country skiing marathon that attracts thousands of participants from around the world. The area's unique microclimate, characterized by stable winter temperatures and abundant snowfall, typically allows for skiing from November through April. The trails cater to all skill levels, from gentle loops for beginners to challenging routes through dense spruce forests for advanced skiers.

### The Beskids Mountains
The Beskids Mountains offer diverse opportunities for cross-country skiing across their gentle, rolling landscape. While less developed than the major Nordic centers like Jakuszyce, the region features several maintained trails, particularly in areas around Ustron, Wisla, and the Kubalonka Pass. The relatively low altitude of the Beskids means snow conditions can be variable, but when conditions are favorable, skiers can enjoy peaceful routes through mixed forests and along mountain ridges, often with fewer crowds than found in the more popular Tatra or Karkonosze regions.

- **Wisla and Istebna**
Wisla and Istebna, neighboring towns in the Silesian Beskids, share a rich tradition of cross-country skiing enhanced by their mountainous terrain and extensive forest coverage.

- **Krynica-Zdroj and Tylicz**
Krynica-Zdrój and nearby Tylicz offer an enchanting setting for cross-country skiing in the Lower Beskids, though their facilities are more modest compared to Poland's major Nordic centers. Due to the region's relatively low elevation, snow conditions can be inconsistent throughout the winter season, making it advisable to check conditions before planning a trip specifically for cross-country skiing.

The trails around Bedřichov are particularly well-maintained, with options ranging from gentle loops for beginners to challenging routes through dense spruce forests.

### Sumava National Park

The area boasts over 450 kilometers of maintained cross-country trails, with major centers around Kvilda, Modrava, and Železná Ruda. The region's relatively high elevation plateau, combined with its northern latitude, ensures reliable snow conditions throughout the winter season.
